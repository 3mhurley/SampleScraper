# SampleScraper

## What is it

Whenever you visit the site, the app will scrape stories from a random news outlet and display them for the user. Each scraped article will be saved to the application database and display the following information for each article:

* Headline - the title of the article
* Summary - a short summary of the article
* URL - the url to the original article
* Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).

Users are also able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database and associated with their articles as well . Users then have the ability to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
